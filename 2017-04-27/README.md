**Instrument:** usPAX

**Content summary:**
--------------------------------
I. Developing workflow

II. Changes to multicounter lv

III. usALEX sm measurements


--------------------------------
**I. Developing workflow**

- Organizing file system such that each project has same subfolders
- File organization system requires a 'lab notebook' that is a **daily log**

**II. Xavier made changes to multicounter lv**

- Scan can now be run in parallel
- 64 curves are plotted in histogram

**III. usALEX - smMEASUREMENT**

Laser power:

532nm: 190uW

628nm: 80uW

001: 7d, 1-10e-5 dilution, high-FRET

- sample is **excellent** for sm measurements on usPAX

002: 12d, 1-10e-5 dilution, mid-FRET

- sample is **excellent** for sm measurements on usPAX

003: 22d, 1-10e-5 dilution, low-FRET

- too dilute, but promising

**Measure samples again with laser powers G~190uW, R~100uW**
