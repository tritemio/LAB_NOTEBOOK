- Aligned red SPAD to red laser
- red LCOS pattern is mirrored - Antonio added channel options to LV to accomodate
- I didn't plug in correct jacks into picomotor driver resulting in misalignment of green SPAD
- prepared dsDNA FRET sample: `NT(-5) ATTO550_ T(+10) ATTO 647N`

- Aligning SPADs to green laser
- Aligning SPADs to red laser
- setting final configuration settings for both LCOSs wrt both SPADs
- Added rotation (x,y) fitting to alignment notebook - 'Alignment summary - Laser G' in 2017-04-04 in alignment folder 
- Final configuration for green LCOS: 

**x,y pitch = (23.14, 24.30)** \\
**rotation = 1.25**

- Rotation for red SPAD is counter clockwise (mirroring of red LCOS reverts direction of rotation)
- Final configuration for red LCOS:

**x,y pitch = (22.60,23.00)** \\
**rotation = -1.05**
