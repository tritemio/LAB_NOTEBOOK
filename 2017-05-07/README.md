**I. How long does it take to set up and fine align**

- less than 1 hour including a bathroom break

**I. smFRET-PAX measurements**

- 22d at 300pM is ideal sm concentration
- small burst size for A, increasing power 2x does not hugely improve signal
- measuring at 628nm various laser powers, and avoiding higher powers to prevent
  background fluctuations.
- many promising samples - need to check notebook results for idea power...
