**I. Fine alignment scan with rotation**

- see image saved in alignment folder for this day - describes our model for
  why the fits are improved when we add rotation to both LCOS confs.

**CONCLUSION**

Always perform scans with rotation in both LCOS confs.



**II. Optimizing powers for smFRET-PAX measurements**

- s1: 12d, 7.5nM,
