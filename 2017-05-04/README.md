**I. Testing for source of 628nm laser background variation and leakage

II. smFRET-PAX measurements**





----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power 628nm: 100mW
AOM continuous, ON
12d dsDNA =7.5 uM
Monitoring DONOR counts

Data is saved in **manta - alignment** folder, analysis in
'Timetrace from Manta Monitor Analysis 2017-05-04'

- checking DCR with and without filter for free A647N, 12d dsDNA
   labeled with A647N, and TE50 buffer only
- excel file with results is probably not accurate... I took notes in the
  dark... and probably also switched the order of some entries...
  Not so smart.

**CONCLUSION**

- background variation is NOT from 628nm leakage
- something with emission of A?? Like there is a reverse leakage

- testing free A647N at various concentration and powers
- testing 12d dsDNA dual-labeled sample, at various concentration and powers
- testing alignment mixture

**We do not observe fluctuations anymore**. We hope that the varying
background is an artifact.

EVERYTHING LOOKS STABLE EVEN AT HIGH POWERS (800mW)

**II. smFRET-PAX measurements**

- first measurement was not saved properly so I aborted it.
- second measurement is same sample: 12d dsDNA, 750pM (see metadata).
  This is a good concentration for smFRET
- May have collected a whole set of data with the R laser blocked, either that
  or I did not save the file... Check for R laser in **sample 7.**
- some promising samples otherwise
