Measured Eitan's hybridized dsDNA on the usALEX set-up
(hybridized samples are in 4C in blue box on top shelf)

sample: (-8)TA(+10)NTD

Note:
A = ATTO550
D = ATTO647N

dilution: 10,000x
(1-100, then 1-100)

Analysis of sample (myatest bc Yazan spelled my name wrong)
revealed large acceptor only population and was deemed inadequate for
proof-of-principle on the multispot

Preparing new hybridized dsDNA via volumetric titration of (+10)NTD with (-8)TA
