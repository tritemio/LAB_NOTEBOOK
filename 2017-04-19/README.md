NOTE: ALIGNMENTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITH EITHER 532nm LP em filter OR
WITH 628nm LP em filter (after excitation dichroic)

taking first real usPAX measurement to test pipeline to server
then we plan to align the red laser better for data collection

Images:
- conf1_4x12_G: taken with 532nm LP em filter, 50ms exp time
- conf1_4x12_R: taken with 628nm LP em filter, 50ms exp time
- conf1_4x12_G_R: taken with 628nm LP em filter, 25ms exp time

Alignment:

Green LCOS (both lasers on)
- Adjust position away from *preset conf* of LCOS with
LCOS gui until center pixel's signal is optimized
- move SPAD via 'picomotor control' notebook in LCOS units
until equal to offset determined with time trace
