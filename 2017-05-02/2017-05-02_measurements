**IV. sm measurements!!**

- sm measurements of 12d dsDNA sample at different powers
- signal from 532nm laser is much more intense than signal from the 628nm laser,
  even when both laser powers are set to 100mW and power is maximized with
  the half wave plate
- smFRET measurements look good! Still need to determine source of high, fluctuating
  R background
- Test measurements are saved in smdata folder:

1) R laser only

2) R laser only, AOM on and alternation OFF - changed sample, same dilution tube

3) R and G lasers, AOM on and alternation OFF - same gasket from 2)
