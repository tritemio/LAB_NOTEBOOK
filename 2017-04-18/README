Emission filter arrived yesterday afternoon (2017-04-17)
Intended to align both detectors to both lasers, but discovered
the LCOS GUI (labview) was not working properly.

Error lights on both LCOSs

Antonio discovered that error was due to display

Computer settings for multiple screen displays:

- 60 Hz
- 800 x 600 resolution

Alignment was not performed -
instead Antonio fixed the LCOS GUI 'pattern_from_YAML'

Antonio let me finish the wiring in the block diagram.
I saved the block diagram and the front panel labview
then I committed the changes via 'Git GUI' under the
description, 'pattern_from_YAML - complete'

After quitting labview and reopening 'pattern_from_YAML',
the updated GUI is working i.e. when run it populates the
array with input field values
