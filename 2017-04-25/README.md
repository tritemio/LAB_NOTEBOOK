Camera

Today, Antonio and I did some house keeping.
We organized (wip) the 'mantas' notebooks and put
data specific notebooks in their respective days.

LEAVE ONLY GENERAL NOTEBOOKS IN DATA FOLDER -
duplicate notebooks and save it in data folder for corresponding day

'LCOS pattern fitting' notebook for comparing GREEN and RED images 
'Alignment Summary - Lasers G/R' ---> renamed as follows:

'Alignment Summary - LCOSs'

because we are comparing alignment of RED and GREEN SPADs
wrt the GREEN laser

Hammering out the alignment protocol

- Use camera to determine LCOS coordinates
  Note: (cross-hairs from eyepiece should match camera cross-hairs)
- Perform three scans:
  1. Scan GREEN SPAD with GREEN laser
      - adjust SPAD via LCOS units
  2. Scan RED SPAD with GREEN laser
      - adjust SPAD via LCOS units
  3. Scan RED SPAD with RED laser
      - DO NOT adjust SPAD - collect statistics for pattern ONLY

CONCLUSION

Two ways to adjust pitch, position, and roation can be set with camera
or from scans. The two data should yield similar results.
