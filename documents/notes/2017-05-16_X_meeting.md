**Proposals and timelines***

- June 5th, small animal imaging proposal

- July 5th, small animal imaging proposal

- July 5th, multispot proposal renewal

typically apply for renewal before the grant is over, it's been 1.5 years
because we don't have the results we promised

* Xavier to send proposal
* invited to add to proposal if I can...
* Xavier has extended the resubmission deadline

**Previous ideas**

- 3 color ALEX? We stopped at 2 colors
- RNAP

**New focuses and ideas for the proposal**

two applications: counting (48-spot), TCSPC i.e. two systems in one

- formulator
- Red enhanced SPAD for 32x1 with TCSPC capabilities
  * if it doesn't work in the red channel, try with green only (?)
  * lifetime measurements, polarization/anisotropy
- different array geometries + formulator
- Polimi contribution
- light sheet illumination + red enhanced
  * instead of LCOS
- push the boundaries of dynamical studies - talk to Sang Yoon and Yazan about
  previously failed experiments
- microfluidics/stop-flow mixer - designs and purchasing options


- in vivo detection (maybe a thesis topic for me)

Polimi

* red enhanced 4x12
* SPAD geometries (options for red enhanced are limited?)
  - round pixel
  - rectangle pixel
  - transistor in chip
* TCSPC considerations
  - requires router (polimi)
  - parallel acquisiton
  - mini tragectory
  - fast diffusion
